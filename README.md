🚀 Hackaphasia – AI-Powered Medical Report Simplifier
📌 Overview

Our project is an AI-powered health assistant designed to analyze complex medical reports, simplify them into easy-to-understand insights, and predict possible health outcomes or risks.

By empowering patients with clear, proactive health information, Hackaphasia helps them take preventive measures early instead of waiting for health issues to become critical.

🏥 Problem Statement:
Medical reports are often filled with technical jargon that most patients struggle to understand. This creates a communication gap between doctors and patients, often delaying preventive healthcare decisions.

Hackaphasia bridges this gap by simplifying medical reports and providing early health predictions through an intelligent AI system.
